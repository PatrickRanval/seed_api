Questions for Joe

Cursory overview, is this a sensibly set up project?

I *think* vendor and source can be polymorphic. Some vendors are just vendors, some sources are just sources, but some vendors are themselves sources. 

Likewise, model "SourceRecord" has some overlap with the yet ungenerated model "Listing" in cases where the vendor is the source.  Structurally this is at the edge of my understanding and knowledge to know how to set up. I'm looking for the efficient way to handle this. 

Should I include Invoices?

Do my relationships look good and set up properly?
